Is she right?
As part of your job requirements at Google, you are occasionally asked to
interview candidates for employment.
One of your favorite questions is “show me some code segment that you deem
particularly “interesting …” ”
The candidate you are currently interviewing shows you the following c++
expression:
((n&(n-1)) == 0)
As you scratch your head, she says “this returns true if n is either zero or a power
of 2.”
Is she correct in her claim?
Prove or disprove.
